# 🔍 Help Me Debug Your Errors

I need more information to help you fix the errors. Please share:

## 📋 What I Need:

### 1. **What error message do you see?**
   - Copy the exact error text
   - Is it in the browser?
   - Is it on the screen or in console?

### 2. **Where are you seeing it?**
   - When trying to login?
   - When trying to register?
   - When loading a page?
   - In the browser console?

### 3. **Browser Console Errors:**
   - Press **F12** (or **Cmd+Option+I** on Mac)
   - Go to **Console** tab
   - Look for **red error messages**
   - Copy and paste them here

### 4. **Network Tab Errors:**
   - Press **F12**
   - Go to **Network** tab
   - Try the action that fails (login/register)
   - Find the failed request (red)
   - Click on it
   - Go to **Response** tab
   - Copy the error message

### 5. **What URL are you using?**
   - Is it the Vercel URL?
   - What's the exact URL?

## 🧪 Quick Tests:

### Test 1: Check if API works
Open this in your browser:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/debug
```

### Test 2: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click on **"Functions"** tab
4. Check for any errors

### Test 3: Check Deployment
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your latest deployment
3. Check the **logs** for errors

## 📸 Screenshots Help Too!

If you can, take a screenshot of:
- The error message
- The browser console
- The network tab

## 💬 Common Error Patterns:

**"500 Internal Server Error"**
→ Database connection issue or server error

**"404 Not Found"**
→ Route doesn't exist

**"CORS error"**
→ Frontend/backend connection issue

**"Network error"**
→ Can't reach the server

**"Authentication required"**
→ Vercel protection is enabled (this is normal for preview URLs)

Please share the specific error details so I can help you fix it!
